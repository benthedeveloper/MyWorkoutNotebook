My Workout Notebook
===================

Purpose
-------------------
The main goal of working out is to improve yourself! Just going to the gym and doing workouts can get results, but not for too long. After a while your results will plateau. If you want lasting results, you need to keep track of your exercises and reps, that way you can try to do a little bit more each time. The purpose of this app is to provide an easy way to log workouts, focusing on providing an easy way for you to see what you did last time, so you can try to do a bit more. Future add-ons will be goal-setting and statistics, so you can see if you're on track.

Audience
------------------
* **Athletes:** Improving on workouts can increase athletic performance.
* **Bodybuilders:** Keeping track of workouts is key to being a successful bodybuilder.
* **Serious or Casual gym-goers:** Whether you are a total gym-rat or just go to the gym sometimes, tracking your workouts will allow you to improve!
